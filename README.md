# Spring Boot with Spring Security

Please go through this [basic-security/README.md](https://github.com/codesuman/spring-auth/blob/basic-security/README.md) before reading further. 

This project demonstrates the use of Spring Security in a Spring Boot application, including custom authentication with `AuthenticationManager`, `AuthenticationProvider`, and `UserDetailsService`.

In this exercise, we will focus on implementing Custom Filter `JwtFilter` : Validates JWT tokens.

**TODO** : Document about `JwtFilter`, `JwtService` & inclusion of `JwtFilter` to `SecurityConfig`.
