# Spring Boot
This is a basic Spring Boot application that includes a REST controller to handle HTTP GET requests.

## Filters and Filter Chains in Spring

### What is a Filter?
In the context of a web application, a filter is a component that can intercept, inspect, and potentially modify incoming HTTP requests and outgoing HTTP responses. Filters are part of the servlet specification and provide a way to perform operations such as logging, authentication, authorization, input validation, and more before the request reaches the servlet (controller in Spring).

- Example Uses:
  - Logging request details.
  - Performing authentication and authorization checks.
  - Modifying request or response headers.
  - GZIP compression of responses.
  - Input validation and sanitation.

### What is a Filter Chain?
A filter chain is a sequence of filters that a request and response must pass through before reaching the target resource (like a servlet or a controller) and before the response is returned to the client. Each filter in the chain performs its task and then passes the request and response objects to the next filter in the chain.

- Filter Chain Example:
1. Authentication Filter
2. Logging Filter
3. Authorization Filter
4. Controller

### How Does a HTTP Request Go from Filters to Controllers?
When a client makes an HTTP request to a Spring web application, the following sequence of events occurs:

#### 1. Incoming Request:

- The client sends an HTTP request to the server.

#### 2. Servlet Filter Chain:

- The request first enters the servlet filter chain. This chain is composed of all the filters configured for the application, either through annotations like ```@Component``` or via configuration classes.

#### 3. Processing by Filters:

- Each filter in the chain processes the request in the order they are configured.
- A filter performs its specific task (e.g., logging, authentication) and then calls the next filter in the chain using ```filterChain.doFilter(request, response)```.
- If a filter decides to terminate the request processing (e.g., in case of authentication failure), it can stop the chain, and the request will not proceed further.

#### 4. Dispatch to Controller:

- After passing through all the filters, the request reaches the ```DispatcherServlet```, which is the front controller in Spring.
- The ```DispatcherServlet``` dispatches the request to the appropriate Spring MVC controller based on the URL mapping.

#### 5. Controller Processing:

- The controller processes the request, interacts with services and repositories if needed, and returns a response (e.g., a view name or a JSON object).

#### 6. Outgoing Response:

- The response generated by the controller is sent back through the filter chain in reverse order, allowing each filter to process the response (e.g., adding headers) before it is sent to the client.

### Example Flow:

**1. Client Request:** A client sends a request to /hello.

**2. Filter Chain:**
- Logging Filter: Logs the request headers.
- Authentication Filter: Checks if the user is authenticated.
- Authorization Filter: Checks if the user has the right permissions.

**3. Controller:**
- The request is handled by BasicController's sayHello method, returning "Hello World".

**4. Response:** The response "Hello World" goes back through the filter chain and is sent to the client.

### Summary
Filters and filter chains allow for pre-processing and post-processing of requests and responses, providing a flexible way to handle cross-cutting concerns in web applications. They ensure that every request and response can be examined and modified before reaching the controller or being sent to the client.
